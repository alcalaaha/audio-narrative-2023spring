My project hit about 1 minute and 30 seconds. I could have made it go on longer . If I had more time, I would have included conversations 
over the walkie-talkie. I included the mention of it, which we call a “radio” at work, to set up for conversations between the other lifeguards and managers. 
I was not able to record something or effectively use the Audacity effects to make it sound as if my voice was coming through a radio, so I did not include it. 
I also could have added towards the end, after the kid was pulled out of the water, a scenechange where the lifeguards debrief, or talk to the kid and their parents,
but with just me doing the voices, I felt like it wouldn’t have come across the way I wanted it to.
I tried to include discrete events in the background like someone running, a lifeguard at the other end of the pool blowing their whistle, and someone 
accidentally hitting the button on their radio, causing it to go off a few times. It might be very obvious, but I recorded all of the voice lines. 
I work at a pool on campus, so I wanted to try to record our diving board being used to put  in the background of my audio, but there was too much background noise with echoes and talking, and others.
All of my downloaded sounds were from Freesounds, all with creative commons licenses. All of my credits are written down in my README with links leading 
to where I found them. I have multiple instances of overlapping sound, but I think the most is when you hear the lifeguard’s heartbeat as they whistle, 
call the active drowning, and jump in the water (shown in the image below). I met all the deadlines except having a full draft by January 26, and completing this assessment by Tuesday's class. 
I did not receive any feedback from classmates, due to not completing the full draft, but I took into account in-person feedback on how to make my voice sound more clear
by removing the background noise.
