In this audio clip, you can hear the ambient sounds of an outdoor pool in the background, with water movement and people talking and playing.
There is then a set of footsteps approaching where a lifeguard is sitting.
During this pause after the initial steps, there will be a short conversation between the sitting lifeguard and the one who walked up, as they will be switching places at this station. 
The lifeguard leaving will then say something back, and walk away, which is represented by the second set of footsteps fading out to right.
After the guard leaves, there is another pause as the new guard gets settled. I plan to add the sound of clothes rustling or the clinking of a whistle.

A large splash is heard off to the side, and the guard quickly blows their whistle. I haven't recorded the audio for this part, but the guard will yell "No front-flips!", letting the listener envision what just happened.
I included this action because I think it's essential to a pool setting to have someone not following the rules. (It's crazy how often it happens, even after we tell people not to multiple times)
When the whistle is blown, the background noise quickly fades to silence as the patrons in the pool know to listen and pay attention when a whistle goes off.
I wanted to include this observation, as it's always funny to me and my coworkers how serious everyone on the pool deck becomes when one of us blows our whistle.
Once the swimmers realize who the whistle is directed at, the noise comes back as they resume their activities.
After this, my next steps are to add some background sounds as people jump off a diving board, run on the pool deck, and swim around in the water nearby.
